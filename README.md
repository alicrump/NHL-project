# Final Project

For my final project I'm thinking of analyzing NHL data. The Philadelphia Flyers are my favorite team so I'd love a chance to explore the data surrounding their team a bit more. The NHL recently published over 100 years of data dating back to 1917 on their website [www.nhl.com/stats](http://www.nhl.com/stats/). The website also includes player data [www.nhl.com/stats](http://www.nhl.com/stats/player?reportType=season&seasonFrom=20192020&seasonTo=20192020&gameType=2&filter=gamesPlayed,gte,1&sort=points,goals,assists) so I'm planning on using that player data in addition to the team data. I might look at faceoff win percentage and their season record, how many goals they had in a season and their record, goalie save percentage and their record/goals against, or compare some of the statistics of some of their best players. I was looking at the data a bit and couldn't find any way to download it, so Enxie suggested that I web scrape the data. I plan on webscraping the data from the NHL website once I learn how to webscrape. Enxie suggested the website [www.webscraper.io](https://www.webscraper.io) which also includes video tutorials. Once I successfully webscrape the data I will load it into R and begin exploring my data.

Sports analytics allow players and coaches to make more informed decisions by identifying where improvements in performance can be made. More and more teams at professional and even collegiate levels are incorporating statistical information into their practice and game plans, trying to get an edge on their competition in any way possible. The National Hockey League recently digitized and published more than 100 years of box score data, previously unavailable to the public. The website allows for the specification of any statistic for any year and team, for millions of data points. In this project, I create a web application using the recently published NHL data, aiming to identify patterns or tendencies of NHL teams and players. The application allows the user to visualize any statistic for their favorite team over the franchise's history or for a particular season. The application also creates a model to see if the Philadelphia Flyers 2019 - 2020 season is off to a good start. Finally, there is a page which allows for the visualization of any statistic for defunct NHL teams. Through the application we are able to come to a surprising conclusion that certain statistics like penalty kill percentage and poweplay percentage might not have as big of an impact on a team's success as perhaps once widely thought.
